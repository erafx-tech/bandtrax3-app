## Can this be used to track my resistance band workouts with (x3, undersun, elitefts, etc)
Absolutely!  

## What is tempo in the app, and what does it mean?
Tempo is the speed at which you want to perform each portion of the exercise.

For example, 2134 tempo would mean 2 seconds on the eccentric portion of the lift, 1 second at the 'bottom' of the lift, 3 seconds on the conctric, and 4 second at the 'top'.

The eccentric portion is the 'lowering', or the part where the target muscle is lengthening.
The concentric portion is the 'pushing' or 'pulling' movement where there target muscle is shortening.

Examples:
 - Chest Press
   - Concentric is when you push away from your chest
   - Eccentric is when you are bringing the bar closer to your chest
 - Biceps Curls
   - Concentric is when you are bending your elbow
   - Eccentric is when you are lowering the weight back down and straightening your arm.
